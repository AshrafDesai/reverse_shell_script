Reverse Shell Using Python
==========================

This README provides instructions on how to set up and use a basic reverse shell implementation using Python.

Server Side:
------------

1. Save the server-side script (`server.py`) in a directory where you want to run the server.

2. Run the server script:

This script will listen for incoming connections from the client.

Client Side:
------------

1. Save the client-side script (`client.py`) in a directory on the target machine.

2. Modify the `SERVER_HOST` variable in `client.py` to match the IP address or hostname of the server where `server.py` is running.

3. Run the client script:

This script will attempt to connect to the server specified by `SERVER_HOST`.

Using the Reverse Shell:
------------------------

Once the server is running and the client script is executed on the target machine, you should see a connection established on the server side.

You can now enter commands on the server side, and they will be executed on the client machine. The output will be displayed on the server side.

Security Considerations:
------------------------

1. Ensure that you have proper authorization before executing the client script on any machine.
2. Use secure communication channels if deploying this in a production environment.
3. Be aware of the potential risks associated with running remote commands on machines.
